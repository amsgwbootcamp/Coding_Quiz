# Coding_Quiz
This project will test your knowledge of Javascript.

To begin the quiz, you will need to select the Begin The Quiz button. 
Once you click Begin The Quiz button, you will have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions.  For each question you get incorrect, 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer.  

If you answer all 10 questions before the time runs out, the quiz will stop and the timer will show your remaining seconds.  You will then be prompted to enter your name or initials so that your score can be displayed on the View Scores page.  You will then be redirected to the main page.  

If the timer runs out before you can answer all of the questions, you will be prompted to enter your name or initials so that your score will be recorded.  You will be returned to the main page.

From the main page, you will be able to select Begin The Quiz or View Scores.

If you choose to View Scores, you will see your score displayed on the screen.  If you click the Clear Scores  button, your score will be removed from the list.   If you click the Back To Main Page, you will be redirected to the main page again.
